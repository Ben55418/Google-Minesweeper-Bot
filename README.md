# Google-Minesweeper-Bot
A Python bot that can play Google Minesweeper


## Instructions
Have Google Minesweeper open on your main monitor for pyautogui to recognize. Upon opening, provide the program with "easy", "medium" or "hard". The bot should automatically find the game and start playing (try to avoid similarly green colors in the background).

## Additional instructions
typing the "exit" command will quit the program
typing the "delay" command will allow the user to set the start delay of the bot (in seconds). Useful for single-monitor setups
